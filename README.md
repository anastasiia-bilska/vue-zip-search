## Usage

To use the app, simply enter a US zip code in the search bar and click the "Search" button or wait. The app will provide information about the city and state associated with the zip code. Alternatively, the app can also detect location based on your IP address and provide information about your current city, region, ZIP-code, country, IP, ISP, User Agent, UTM tags and referer (if you came from the outside source). The app will show errors if your ZIP-code is not valid or something wrong with API or Internet Connection.
